This file demonstrates how you can control a sorting function by giving it a 
function to use when comparing two elements of the list.

Notice that we sort the list of strings by putting the ones that are
"smallest" in a sense at the front, but we later sort a list of dicts by
putting the ones that are "biggest" in a sense at the front. What determines
this orientation (ascending or descending order) is the return value from the
function we pass to sort. We simply need that function to return -1 if the
first argument should appear before the second argument in the final sorted
list, +1 if it should appear after, and 0 if their relative order doesn't
matter.

In this demo, and in the provided Twitter sorting function, we're using the
insertion sort algorithm. This could be replaced with any other sorting 
algorithm; we just chose one that you've already learned.
